= Which contact form options do I have? =
vCita offers three contact form options to engage more visitors within your website:

*  Active Engage (proactive contact form) - display "call-to-action" at the bottom of your web page.
*  Contact Form - an alternative to your existing contact form, with an option to request a service or schedule a meeting on your contact page. 
*  Contact Form Sidebar - add a sidebar to any post or page. Normally, this vertical sidebar, or horizontal header/footer, will have your photo/logo, and a brief invitation to contact you or schedule an appointment.
<br>

= How do I customize the photo and text in my contact form or widget? =
Once you enter your email, you will receive an email from vCita to complete your registration. (or you can do it directly from the plugin settings)<br>

<br>


= How do I choose between Contact Form and Contact Widget? = 
In addition to the proactive contact form, you probably want to choose between Contact Form that has an option for scheduling a meeting, and a Contact Form on the side bar that's a smaller version, with two buttons - "Send a message" and "Set a meeting".<br>
In the plugin settings page you'll be able to preview the two options.<br>
